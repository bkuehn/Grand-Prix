Grand Prix Scorer is a simple text based Java program that helps keep score
of a Grand Prix/Pinewood Derby type of race.

Grand Prix Scorer takes input from the user (number of cars, name of the cars if applicable,
number of available lanes, and number of rounds wanted) to create a randomized lineup of
racers. It calculates the number of heats needed, assigns cars randomly to positions in 
both lanes and heats, and then shows them to the user.

The user then inputs the places for each racer. After scores have been recorded,
Grand Prix Scorer then calculates the total scores and chooses the finalists for the
last round based on lowest score and number of available lanes. The finalists
are then randomly assigned lanes and heats (if applicable).

Grand Prix scorer can easily be saved on your computer and run through the command prompt.
